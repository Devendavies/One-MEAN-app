        <a>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<a>
        Two players are robbers trying to escape justice, while two are police constables trying to
catch the robbers. For 4 players (playing in teams, two robbers versus two cops). You
need one die each, and paper and pencil.
Aim of the game: The robbers win if one or both can get down to 0 before being caught
by the cops; and the cops win if they catch both robbers before then.
How to play: The players sit around the table in the order cop-robber-cop-robber. One
player keeps score: One of the robbers starts with 64 points and the other with 66
points, while both cops start with 75 points each.
 Roll one die each: Highest makes the first ”move”, deducting as many points from his
score as the number he rolled. The next roll is made by the robber to the first player’s
left, the next roll again by the cop to the left of the second player, and finally the fourth
player rolls. From then on, you play in clockwise order.
 The number you roll is deducted from your score, so that you have fewer and fewer
points left as the game progresses. A few extra rules are in effect (but only from the
second player round on, not during the initial round): If you roll a 6, you immediately reroll
and deduct one point if you roll 1, 2 or 3, or two points if you roll 4, 5 or 6. If you roll
a 5 in your turn (on your initial roll, not on any re-roll), the player on your left must skip
his turn. If you roll a 4, both the nearest two players on your left miss their turn; and if
you roll the same number as the preceding player (not counting any re-rolls), your throw
does not count and is not deducted from your score.
 If a cop catches a robber (= the same number of points or lower), that robber is out
of the game while the other continues to try to reach 0. If either robber escapes then they win, or else justice prevails once more!</article>
